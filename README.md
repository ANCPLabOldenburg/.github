# Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab
We investigate the processes in the sensation-perception-action-cycle in an interdisciplinary team. Central to our research are cutting edge brain decoding methods which we use to learn from EEG, ECoG, MEG, or real time fMRI data how the brain accomplishes everyday tasks. The aim of our research is twofold. On the one hand we are interested in basic research questions on how the brain constructs percepts from environmental sensory data, represents percepts, makes decisions, and controls muscles to interact with the environment. On the other hand we are interested in constructing brain-machine interfaces to supplement human cognition, communication, and motor function. More detailed information can be found on the [projects](https://uol.de/en/applied-neurocognitive-psychology/projects) page.

Furthermore, we participate in the [Open Science](https://uol.de/psychologie/open-science) project. In collaboration with the [Neuroimaging Unit](https://uol.de/neuroimaging), we develop software solutions aiming at providing support for open and reproducible scientific work. For more information on our work in this regard see the website of the DFG funded core centre ["Tools for Open and Reproducible Science"](https://uol.de/psychologie/open-science/tors).
